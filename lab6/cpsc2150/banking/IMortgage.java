/**
 * This object will hold the information about a mortgage, and will handle all calculations for interest rate and monthly payments
 * @Defines: Payment: R - The monthly payment on the mortgage
 *          Rate: R - the interest rate per monthly period on the loan
 *          Customer: - Every loan must have an associated customer
 *          DebtToIncomeRatio: R - The ratio of the Customer's total monthly debt payments (including mortgage) to their monthly income
 *          Principal: R - The amount of the loan
 *          NumberOfPayments: Z - total number of payments the customer will make on the loan
 *          PercentDown : R - The percent of the house cost covered by the down payment
 *
 * @Initialization Ensures: [Rate is calculated based on the BASERATE, the years for the loan, and the PercentDown]
 *                          [Payment is calculated]
 *
 * @Constraints: Payment = (Rate * Principal) / (1-(1+Rate)^ -NumberOfPayments)
 *               0 <= Rate <= 1
 *               0 < DebtToIncomeRatio
 *               MIN_YEARS * 12 <= NumberOfPayments <= MAX_YEARS * 12
 *               0 < Principal
 *               0 <= PercentDown < 1
